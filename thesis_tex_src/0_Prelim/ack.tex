I would like to thank Alexander Sergienko, David Simon, and Shuto Osawa for guiding me through the entire journey of Quantum Computing from the theoretical to the experimental and for providing me this fulfilling opportunity. I would like to thank Professor John Butler of the BU Physics Department for his excellent Modern Physics course that inspired to go down the road of pursuing a deeper background in Physics which lead to obtaining a minor in Physics. I would like to thank my AP Physics B high school teacher Richard Newton for channeling and generating an enormous passion for Physics and spurring me towards Engineering during my senior year in High School. I would like to thank my parents and my sister for being there for support and encouragement every step of the way. Lastly, I want to thank my friends from high schools and BU for trying their best to keeping me sane and entertained through this journey. Quick shoutout to my fellow physics partner-in-crime and friend from high school, Nick Russo for enlightening late night science discussion!
